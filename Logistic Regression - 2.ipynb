    "## Q1. What is the purpose of grid search CV in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "Grid search with cross-validation (Grid Search CV) is used to:\n",
    "- Find the optimal hyperparameters of a model by exhaustively searching through a specified set of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "- Ensure robust model evaluation by splitting the data into training and validation sets during cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. Specify a range of hyperparameter values for the model.\n",
    "2. For each combination of hyperparameters:\n",
    "   - Perform cross-validation (e.g., k-fold).\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., using accuracy, F1-score).\n",
    "3. Select the combination of hyperparameters that yields the best performance.\n",

    "## Q2. Describe the difference between grid search CV and randomized search CV, and when might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences:\n",
    "1. **Grid Search CV**:\n",
    "   - Exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "   - Time-consuming for large search spaces.\n",
    "2. **Randomized Search CV**:\n",
    "   - Randomly samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations.\n",
    "   - Faster for large or complex search spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use:\n",
    "- Use **Grid Search CV** for smaller, well-defined hyperparameter spaces.\n",
    "- Use **Randomized Search CV** for larger hyperparameter spaces or when computational resources are limited.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Leakage:\n",
    "- Occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n",
    "- Problem: Causes the model to perform well on training/testing but poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Including a future feature (e.g., total sales in the next month) while predicting whether a customer will churn.\n",

    "   - Keep training, validation, and test datasets distinct.\n",
    "2. **Pipeline Usage**:\n",
    "   - Use pipelines to ensure preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling) are only applied to training data.\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - Avoid using features that won't be available during inference.\n",
    "4. **Time-Based Splitting**:\n",
